## Antecipation

#### About this app

- At the begining I setup my own webpack to start code at localhost and a build to production mode.
- For the components I decided to use webcomponents.
- For testing I've used `jest` (unit tests) and `cypress` to e2e
- For requests I decided to use axios cause is very simple to use

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Clone this repo

2. **Install all dependencies.**

   ```shell
   npm i

   ```

3. **Start `develop` mode.**

   ```shell
   npm start
   `localhost:3000`
   ```

What's included?

- [x] Webcomponents
- [x] A folder structure with only components that we can reuse in all applications
- [x] A folder structure for `pages`. In this case we only have one, but the main idea is to make it scalable for other pages
- [x] Axios for requests

## ðŸš¥ Testing

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser

#### Available commands

`npm i` to install all dependencies

`npm start` to run app at `localhost:3000`

To run the e2e test, we first need to run `npm start` and then` npx cypress open` at the same time
